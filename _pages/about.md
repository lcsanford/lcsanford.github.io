I am a student in the joint PhD program with the Department of Political Science and the School of Global Policy and Strategy. I study methods for using new sources of data, including text and satellite images, to infer causal relationships. I apply these methods to questions about how political forces affect natural resource use and environmental outcomes. 

I graduated from Whitman College with a B.A. in Politics in 2009, after which I worked as a researcher for the International Water Management Institute in Colombo, Sri Lanka, as a ski instructor at Crested Butte, CO, and as an English Teacher at 四川大学，锦江学院 (Sichuan University, Jinjiang College) in Sichuan, China. I surf, ski, climb, kayak, and play tennis while thinking of new research ideas.

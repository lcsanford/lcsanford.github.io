I am a PhD candidate in the joint program with the University of California, San Diego Department of Political Science and the School of Global Policy and Strategy. I develop new methods for using new sources of digital data, including text and satellite images, to measure latent concepts and influences. I use those to help improve inference of causal relationships. I apply these methods to questions about how political forces affect natural resource use and environmental outcomes. My work has appeard in *Environmental Research Letters*, *Natural Resources Forum*, *Water Resources Development*, and is accepted at the *American Journal of Political Science*.

I graduated from Whitman College with a B.A. in Politics in 2009, after which I worked as a researcher for the International Water Management Institute in Colombo, Sri Lanka, as a ski instructor at Crested Butte, CO, and as an English Teacher at 四川大学，锦江学院 (Sichuan University, Jinjiang College) in Sichuan, China. I surf, ski, climb, kayak, and play tennis while thinking of new research ideas.

I am the instructor of record for GPS's math camp course for incoming masters students. The course covers topics in elementary mathematics through multivariable differential calculus. I have taught the course each year since 2015. Most recent syllabus is [here](https://github.com/lcsanford/lcsanford.github.io/blob/master/files/Math%20Camp%20Syllabus%202020.pdf). In 2020 there were 151 students enrolled.

I teach the statistics and probability portion of the mathematical and statistical foundations course for incoming students in the weeks before the start of the academic year. The course covers foundational concepts from statistics and probability, including applications of continuous and discrete probability distributions. I have taught this course since 2019.
Most recent syllabus is [here](https://github.com/lcsanford/lcsanford.github.io/blob/master/files/270---2020.pdf). In 2020 there were 23 students enrolled.
